Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering (Shiny App)

📌 Project Overview

This project performs Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering in R and presents the results through an interactive Shiny Dashboard. The application allows users to explore customer segmentation dynamically, providing insights that can help businesses optimize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

🚀 Features

The application provides an interactive Shiny Dashboard that allows users to segment customers based on their spending behavior and annual income. It includes an Elbow Method Plot, which helps in determining the optimal number of clusters for analysis. Users can dynamically select the number of clusters, and the system will execute real-time data processing to perform K-Means Clustering, ensuring immediate results and an efficient user experience. The cluster visualization feature, implemented using ggplot2 and factoextra, presents customer groups in an easy-to-understand scatter plot. These features allow businesses and analysts to explore customer behavior, identify key spending trends, and make data-driven decisions for improved marketing strategies and customer engagement.
